# React Image Gallery


Overview
This is a customizable and responsive image gallery built using React. It allows users to view, reorder, delete multiple images, and set a feature image.


## Features

- **Grid Layout:** Images are displayed in a grid layout, with one feature image larger than the others for visual distinction.
- **Reordering:** You can easily rearrange the order of images in the gallery using drag-and-drop functionality.
- **Delete Multiple Images:** Select multiple images and delete them with the click of a button. Selected images are visually indicated.
- **Feature Image:** The first image (from the left-to-right direction) is considered the feature image and is visually distinct.
- **Responsive:** The gallery is responsive and adjusts to various screen sizes, providing a smooth user experience.
